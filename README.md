## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- VS Code

### What I learned

With the help of Kevin Powell's videos on responsive design, I was able to redo this exercise using significantly fewer media queries! I learned to implement `min()`, `max()` and `clamp()`. The result is much cleaner and intuitive for the browser, as well as easier to read.
